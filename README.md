# Simple Stopwatch GUI

This was my first hands-on project with Python, where I explored building a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using **PyQt5**.

### Key Learning Outcomes:
* **OOP Concepts:** Understanding classes and inheritance in Python.
* **Event Handling:** Managing user interactions with buttons.
* **QTimer:** Implementing real-time updates.

I plan to apply these fundamental skills to develop custom tools for lab data visualization and research workflows.
